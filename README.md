# Hacker Hats

#### Website that defines the various hacker "hat" colors.

I created this site for my Writing 5: Digital Pirates class at Dartmouth
College in Fall 2016. The assignment was to create a "definitional text" to
define a term of our choosing, using any medium other than an essay.

The backend is written in Python using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).

The live site is available at https://hackerhats.benwolsieffer.com. I might not
host the site indefinitely, so if that link doesn't work, [an archive is
available](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://hacker-hats.nsupdate.info/).

If someone happens to look at this and notices a bug, especially security
related, please let me know.
